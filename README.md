# PTZ Camera Self-Georegistration

This project provides a suite of tools to calculate the orientation of a PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) camera relative to a known reference map. The workflow involves three main stages: camera intrinsic calibration, reference alignment matrix (`R_align`) calibration, and finally, calculating the orientation offsets for new query images.

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.9+
-   An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA drivers installed (for PyTorch acceleration).

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project environment.

**1. Unzip the Project**

First, unzip the provided project `.zip` file. This will create a project folder (likely named `ptz_self_georegistration`). Navigate into this directory from your terminal:

```bash
cd path/to/ptz_self_georegistration
```

**2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

*   On Windows:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
*   On macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

### 3. Install PyTorch with CUDA Support

The version of PyTorch required by this project depends on your specific NVIDIA driver and CUDA version. The packages this project was developed with (`torch==2.8.0+cu129`) were built for **CUDA 12.9**.

**First, check your system's CUDA version.** Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or bash) and run the following command:
```bash
nvidia-smi
```
Look for the `CUDA Version` in the top right corner of the output. Your version must be equal to or higher than the version required by the PyTorch build you choose.

**Next, get the correct installation command:**

*   **If your CUDA version is 12.9 or compatible:** You can likely use the same command that was used for development. However, `+cu129` is not a standard PyTorch wheel. It is safer to use the official build for a slightly different CUDA version, like 12.1 or 12.4, which PyTorch officially supports. Modern drivers are forward-compatible.

*   **For all cases (Recommended):** Go to the [Official PyTorch Website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and use their tool to generate the correct `pip` command. Select the options that match your system (e.g., Stable, Windows, Pip, Python, your CUDA version).

    For example, the official command for PyTorch with CUDA 12.1 is:
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
    ```

*Run the command generated by the website. This is the most reliable way to ensure PyTorch can use your GPU.*


**4. Install Remaining Packages**

Once PyTorch is installed, install the rest of the project's dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file included in the project.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**5. Install the Project Package in Editable Mode**

This step is essential for making the project's internal imports (`from ptz_georeg import ...`) work correctly. Run this command from the project root directory:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

All executable scripts are configured using `.ini` files located in the `configs/` directory. **Before running any script, you must modify the corresponding configuration file** to set the correct paths, parameters, and settings for your experiment.

-   `configs/camera_calibration.ini`: For calibrating camera intrinsics.
-   `configs/calibration.ini`: For calibrating the `R_align` matrix.
-   `configs/orientation_offsets.ini`: For calculating offsets of query images.

## Workflow and Usage

The main workflow is divided into three steps. Run these commands from the project's root directory.

### Step 1: Camera Intrinsics Calibration

This script calculates the camera's intrinsic matrix and distortion coefficients using chessboard images.

1.  **Configure:** Edit `configs/camera_calibration.ini`.
2.  **Run:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/camera_calibration.py --config configs/camera_calibration.ini
    ```
3.  **Output:** A `calibration.npz` file will be saved.

### Step 2: Calibrate Alignment Matrix (R_align)

This script uses a set of reference images to find the rotational alignment (`R_align`) between the camera's and world's coordinate systems.

1.  **Configure:** Edit `configs/calibration.ini`.
2.  **Run:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/calibrate_R_align.py --config configs/calibration.ini
    ```
3.  **Output:** An `R_align.npy` matrix will be saved.

### Step 3: Calculate Orientation Offsets

This script takes query images and uses the pre-computed intrinsics and `R_align` matrix to calculate their orientation offsets.

1.  **Configure:** Edit `configs/orientation_offsets.ini`.
2.  **Run:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/calculateOrientationOffsets.py --config configs/orientation_offsets.ini
    ```
3.  **Output:** An Excel file with the results will be saved.
