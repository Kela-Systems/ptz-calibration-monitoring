# prune-learnings

Clean up the files in /changelog, removing files that have already been processed into @important-learnings.mdc.
For those files that haven't been already, extract important information that you will need to know for future work to @rules/important-learnings.mdc.
Since we will log learning often, keep it concise and practical.
You should also remove conflicting or out of date information.
