# create-tasks-from-prd

I will ask you to break down product requirements doc (PRD) into tasks ("issues") in Linear.
If no Linear project is mentioned in the rules or chat, then you should ask for it, and then create the issues under the project in Linear.
Beyond reviewing the PRD, you should do deep research over the existing code/artifacts in the workspace to gain an understanding of the purpose of the project workspace.
You should then read the PRD, and dive deeper into relevant parts of the code.
You should then use the Linear MCP to create tasks under the relevant project. The tasks should be written in an optimal way for you as a coding agent to understand and execute on them.
